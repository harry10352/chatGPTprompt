**Wondering why you're not getting interview calls?**

You've applied and waited, but no response. The truth is, recruiters aren't ignoring youâ€”they just can't find you on Naukri. Naukri works like Google, and if your profile isn't optimized, it won't rank in recruiter searches.

But there's good news! With a few simple tweaks, you can increase your visibility and start getting interview calls. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Complete Your Profile (100%)**

   - Fill in all sections: experience, skills, education, certifications, etc.
   - Verify your phone number and email to improve credibility.
   - Keep your contact information updated so recruiters can reach you easily.
   - Use a clear, professional photo to build trust. Avoid selfies, casual pics, or low-quality images.
   - A fully completed profile ranks higher in recruiter searches.

2. **Write an Attention-Grabbing Headline**

   - Use a clear job title with key skills (e.g., Data Engineer | Python | SQL | AWS Certified).
   - This helps recruiters quickly understand your expertise.

3. **Optimize Your Summary with Keywords**

   - Describe your experience, key achievements, and career goals.
   - Use industry-specific keywords to increase profile visibility.

4. **Highlight Your Skills**

   - Add all relevant technical and soft skills.
   - Match them with job descriptions for better discoverability.

5. **Upload an ATS-Friendly Resume**

   - Ensure your resume is current, well-structured, and tailored to the roles you're targeting.
   - Use simple formatting and relevant keywords for ATS optimization. Reupload your resume daily around 9-10 AM to indicate your profile is up to date.

6. **Regularly Update Your Profile**

   - Update your profile at least twice a day, morning at 9 AM and afternoon at 2 PM.
   - Frequent updates signal to recruiters that you're an active job seeker, improving your profile's ranking.

7. **Set Job Preferences Correctly**

   - Define your desired role, location, and industry to receive relevant job recommendations.

8. **Enable "I'm Open to Opportunities"**

   - Let recruiters know youâ€™re actively looking for a job.
   - This increases the chances of being contacted.

9. **Be Responsive to Recruiters**

   - Check emails and messages frequently.
   - A quick response can increase your chances of getting shortlisted.

10. **Use the Right Keywords in Every Section**
    - Recruiters use keyword-based searches, so align your profile accordingly.
    - Analyze job descriptions and include commonly used terms.

Small improvements can make a big difference in your job search! Optimize your Naukri profile today and increase your chances of getting interview calls.
